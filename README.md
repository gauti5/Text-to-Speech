# Text to Speech 

Text to Speech is a web application that uses Google Text to Speech gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translateâ€™s text-to-speech API. Writes spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout. It features flexible pre-processing and tokenizing.
